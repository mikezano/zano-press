If you've ever watched old Bugs Bunnies cartoons the below might bring back some core memories to you üê∞

In a [previous post](2025-08-15-Modern-Centering) I was going over how you can center items in a more modern way and I wanted to expand on that to show how to create the above Merry Melodies outro üòÄ

## Html Setup

```html
<main id="container">
  <div class="layer radial-circles"></div>
  <div class="layer blue-circle"></div>
  <svg class="layer" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path
      id="circlePath"
      display="none"
      d="M 50 60
             m -40, 0
             a 40,10 0 1,1 80,0"
    />
    <text>
      <textPath href="#circlePath" startOffset="10%">
        That's All Folks!
      </textPath>
    </text>
  </svg>
</main>
```

- `.container` will hold everything together. It uses CSS grid to help align everything in a centered way
- `.radial-circles` - the red ring curtains
- `.blue-circle` the centered circle where sometimes you'd see someone like Porky Pig üê∑ pop out of
- `<svg />` - this element is the key to having our curved text

## CSS Setup

```css
#container {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  display: grid;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;

  & .layer {
    grid-area: 1/1;
    place-self: center;
  }
}
```

This starting setup is the same as the [modern centering post](2025-08-15-Modern-Centering) which will make all the `.layer` elements stack on top of each other in a centered manner. Let's slowly layer in the pieces in the order of `.radial-circles`, `.blue-circle` , `svg` and add CSS to them.

## Red Ring Curtains

The red rings are formed with 2 shades of red in a radial gradient that draws your eyes to the center.

<style>
  .red-ring-only .blue-circle, .red-ring-only svg{display:none}
</style>
<ThatsAllFolks class="red-ring-only"/>

```css
& .radial-circles {
  width: inherit;
  height: inherit;
  --inner-red: hsla(0, 80%, 45%);
  --outer-red: hsla(0, 80%, 25%);

  background: radial-gradient(
      circle at center,
      transparent 40%,
      var(--inner-red) 40%,
      var(--outer-red) 50%,
      var(--inner-red) 50%,
      var(--outer-red) 60%,
      var(--inner-red) 60%,
      var(--outer-red) 70%,
      var(--inner-red) 70%,
      var(--outer-red) 80%,
      var(--inner-red) 80%,
      var(--outer-red) 90%,
      var(--outer-red) 100%
    ), var(--outer-red);
}
```

In the `radial-gradient` you see an alternating between the two shades of red every 10% that starts at the 40% mark from the center out. This creates the ring effect we see and to fill in the 'center' of this we actually have a 2nd layer on the `background` of a solid `var(--outer-red)` so that we don't have other possible background elements bleed through.

## Blue Circle background

We add a circle on top of the red rings in its 'empty' center to give this the effect of seeing through into a dark blue distance.

```css
& .blue-circle {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: hsla(220, 60%, 25%, 1);
}
```

<style>
  .layer-blue-circle svg{display:none}
</style>
<ThatsAllFolks class="layer-blue-circle"/>

## Curved Text

The `svg` element that draws text deserves a little deeper explanation of its markup which is as follows

```html
<svg class="layer" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path
    id="circlePath"
    display="none"
    d="M 50 60
             m -40, 0
             a 40,10 0 1,1 80,0"
  />
  <text>
    <textPath href="#circlePath" startOffset="10%">That's All Folks!</textPath>
  </text>
</svg>
```

- `<path />` defines an svg path for elements to use as a basis of their shape. In this case the path defined by `d` is an arch shape which our written text will align on
- `<text />` is a standard element for adding text in SVG. We do a
  something a little more fancy by using the `<textPath />` element inside
- `<textPath />` is capable of using a `<path/>`, as its name implies, to draw text on.
  In this case we refer to our previous path with `href='circlePath'`. The text "That's All Folks!" gets written here to give it the curvature

The `<path/>` element is hidden in this case but if we turn it on you would see this shape with a color black fill:

<style>
  .show-path svg path{display:block !important}
</style>
<ThatsAllFolks class="show-path"/>

The only CSS we do have here is a text color fill to make the text white.

```css
& text {
  fill: white;
  font-size: 0.6rem;
}
```

## Final Result

Somewhat resembles the original, right üòÑ? Probably could be another fun excercise with svg animations if the words could be drawn in as they are in the actual Merry Melodies outro üé∂ [Full demo on Codepen](https://codepen.io/_zan0/pen/MYKrNLe)
