# "Hand" drawn scribbles

<Badge :text="$frontmatter.date" />
<Badge :text="$frontmatter.tag" />

No javascript here, this little 'scribble' is actually a result of SVG animation via CSS using the `stroke-dashoffset` property.

<div style="display:flex; gap:1rem">
<AnimatedPathDrawing id="heart" path="M100 180 C 60 140, 20 100, 20 60 C 20 20, 60 20, 100 60 C 140 20, 180 20, 180 60 C 180 100, 140 140, 100 180 Z"/>
<AnimatedPathDrawing id="spiral" path="M20 20 L180 20 L180 180 L20 180 L20 40 L160 40 L160 160 L40 160 L40 60 L140 60 L140 140 L60 140 L60 80 L120 80 L120 120 L80 120 L80 100 L100 100"/>
<AnimatedPathDrawing id="star" path="M100 20 L120 80 L180 80 L140 120 L160 180 L100 150 L40 180 L60 120 L20 80 L80 80 L100 20 Z"/>
</div>

## HTML Setup

```html
<div class="paper">
  <svg class=" drawn-path">
    <path d="..." pathLength="1" />
  </svg>
  <div class="pencil">‚úèÔ∏è</div>
</div>
```

üîë points:

- `.paper` sets up a container that looks like actual notebook paper üìÉ.
- The svg `.drawn-path` element is responsible for holding the `path` element which will specify what actually is drawn.
- The `.pencil` will be "following" the same path to make it look like a proper scribble.

## Make .paper look like paper

Our piece of 'paper' has the following variables and containment definitions.

```css
.paper {
  --duration: 2s;
  --size: 200px;
  position: relative;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  width: var(--size);
  height: var(--size);
  /* notebook lines */
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, white 19px, deepskyblue 20px);
  background-size: 100% 20px;
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
}
```

üîë points:

- `position:relative` is going to help contain the drawn path and pencil icon on the paper
- `display: grid` and `place-content: center` are a more modern approach to centering elements that we use here to get `.drawn-path` and `.pencil` to be on top of each other later on
- The proximity of the `white 19px, deepskyblue 20px` in the `linear-gradient` essentially turn our gradient into a solid line because the gradient is entirely `white` until `19px` and immediately transitions to `deepskyblue` at `20px`.
- Then the `background-size` y value of `20px` combined with the `background-repeat` only doing `repeat-y` will recreate the same gradient all the way to the end of the piece of 'paper'

<style>
    .paper-only{margin-bottom:1rem;}
    .paper-only .pencil, .paper-only .drawn-path{
        display:none;
        
    }

</style>
<div class="paper-only">
    <AnimatedPathDrawing id="paperOnly"/>
</div>

## Centering the drawing and pencil

To ensure the drawing and pencil will actually remain on top of each other and centered we need the following:

```css
.drawn-path,
.pencil {
  position: absolute;
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1;
  height: var(--size);
  width: var(--size);
}
```

- `grid-colum` and `grid-row` are key to having the same value so that these elements occupy the same cell of the grid
- Note that we do specify the `width` and `height` to be the same value to keep everything sized correctly

## Drawing a straight line

A single line svg path for our paper of of size`200px` can be expressed as follows:

`M 100 20 L 100 180 Z`

Here's what each piece means

| Command   | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| M 100 20  | Move (without drawing) to coordinates (100,20) |
| L 100 180 | Start drawing a line down to (100,180)         |
| Z         | Stop drawing                                   |

We plug this in at the mark up and have this on the `path` element

`<path d="M 100 20 L 100 180 Z" pathLength="1" />`

Here's how that would look when animated:

<style>
    .path-only{margin-bottom:1rem;}
    .path-only .pencil{display:none;}

</style>
<div class="path-only">
    <AnimatedPathDrawing id="line" path="M 100 20 L 100 180 Z"/>
</div>

## The actual origin of the SVG

(0,0) in our display's coordinate system usually means to start from the top-left corner. Our SVG line looks like it followed that principle but in reality for SVG (0,0) means start from the "middle" of something. If we let SVG do it's own thing the drawing would look 'shifted' and go off the page. We have to do some `translate` magic to acheive the affect we need and add some other CSS details demonstrated below:

```css
.drawn-path {
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

  & path {
    fill: none;
    stroke: gray;
    stroke-width: 2;
    stroke-dasharray: 1;
    stroke-dashoffset: 1;
    animation: draw var(--duration) linear infinite;
  }
}

@keyframes draw {
  to {
    stroke-dashoffset: 0;
  }
}
```

üîë points:

- The `transform` you see shifting the element `(-50%,-50%)` is the key ingredient that visually centers our scibble within the paper confines.
- We use CSS nesting with the `& path` to better target the element we want to affect
- For `fill:none`, we only care about the 'edges' of our drawing, in the case of a line there is nothing to 'fill' in so, `none` is a good value for our scribbling purposes
- `stroke` is the color of the line and `stroke-width` controls the thickness
- Think of `stroke-dasharray` as the answer to "How many segments do you want your line to be composed of ?". In this case we want a solid single line therefore we use `1`
- Think of `stroke-dashoffset` as the answer to "How much of the line do you want drawn in ?" It's range is 0 to 1 and in this case a positive value of 1 actually shifts things backwards so nothing will be drawn in. By animatin this with the `draw` animation we take the `stroke-dashoffset` value to 0 which essentially 'draws' it in

Here's a visual of what would happen if we didn't do the `transform: translate(...)`

<style>
    .no-transform{margin-bottom:1rem;}
    .no-transform .pencil{display:none;}
    .no-transform .drawn-path {transform: translate(0,0)}

</style>
<div class="no-transform">
    <AnimatedPathDrawing id="line2" path="M100 180 C 60 140, 20 100, 20 60 C 20 20, 60 20, 100 60 C 140 20, 180 20, 180 60 C 180 100, 140 140, 100 180 Z"/>
</div>

## Make the pencil work

Finally the pencil, not as complex as the SVG portion, but we want our pencil to essentially 'follow' the drawing. That can be acheived with this:

```css
.pencil {
  transform: translateY(-20px) translateX(-4px);
  offset-path: path(...); /* The M 100 100 L 100 20 .... etc*/
  offset-rotate: 0deg;
  offset-distance: 0%;
  animation: write var(--duration) linear infinite;
}

@keyframes write {
  to {
    offset-distance: 100%;
  }
}
```

üîë points:

- `transform` here is a bit of manual work just to get the pencil's tip right on the path of the svg drawing. No exact science here just kinda have to visually work it out.
- `offset-path` this is what gives the pencil a path to follow. We use the same value used on the `path` element and supply to the CSS function `path(...)` [more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)
- `offset-rotate` prevents the pencil from actually rotating along the path drawn. We want the pencil to stay upright while moving.
- `offset-distance` is where in the path to start. We start at the beginning, hence `0`
- Our animation `write` then takes care of the rest. It maches the duration, timing-function and repeats infintely to stay in sync with the svg being drawn in. The `offset-distance` is set to `100%` during its animationso the pencil start traveling.

Put it all together and you can draw single stroke elements like the good ol' cool S :D
